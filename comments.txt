Annabel: Why did you scale it up by a 100 if you're running 50 simulations.
Great presentation but very confusing, maybe break it down or explain a little more slowly.


Kevin SDM Presentation:
Pretty cool project. Why would you want to know where the species isn't, ie not use presense-only distribution?
What does bio18 represent and why is it the most powerful variable? What are the variables you used for this program? How did you decide the grid size?

Julia Sequence Similarity:
Sea Urchins, searched genbank What is your research about, outside of this class?
Would this program help with that or could it work with someone elses research if they put in a species and want to blast it?

Sarah bacterial disease in Sealions:
Fishers and fat levels to see if there is correlation. How did you deal with the data set not having an ID?
I am struggling with dictionaries as well, how did you add the data set to it and then call it?
Might be a dumb question, but why is there a correlation between blubber and food? Like what is a reason for it?
